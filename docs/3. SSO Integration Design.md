# SSO Integration Design

## **1. Architectural Overview**

![Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/ArchitectureDiagram.png)
*Note: Please imagine an architecture diagram based on the description below.*

### **Key Components:**

1. **Keycloak (IdP):**
   - Manages authentication and user federation via LDAP and Kerberos.
   - Handles OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols for SSO.

2. **External Nginx Reverse Proxy:**
   - Terminates HTTPS connections.
   - Forwards authenticated requests to the internal Apache server.

3. **Internal Apache Web Server:**
   - Serves as the primary web server for legacy applications.
   - Utilizes `mod_auth_openidc` to handle OIDC with Keycloak.
   - Sets the `X-Remote-User` header based on authenticated user information.

4. **Intermediate Gateway Application (FastAPI):**
   - Acts as a bridge for API access, handling token-based authentication.
   - Manages long-lived API access tokens for utility scripts.
   - Interfaces with Keycloak for token validation and management.

5. **NetDisco (Perl Dancer Application):**
   - Receives authenticated user information via the `X-Remote-User` header.
   - Provides REST APIs protected by the gateway application.

6. **Docker Compose:**
   - Orchestrates containerized deployment of all components.
   - Ensures consistent environments and simplifies service management.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Utilizes existing infrastructure monitoring tools and centralized Syslog.
   - Tracks authentication events, token usage, and access patterns.

## **2. Detailed Component Design**

### **2.1. Keycloak Configuration**

- **Realm Setup:**
  - Single realm for all applications (excluding the master realm).
  - Configure clients for web applications and API access.

- **User Federation:**
  - Integrate LDAP and Kerberos for user and group management.
  - Ensure synchronization and consistency with existing user directories.

- **Client Configuration:**
  - **Web Clients:** Configure OIDC clients for Apache to handle web authentication.
  - **API Clients:** Set up clients for the gateway application to manage API tokens.

### **2.2. External Nginx Reverse Proxy**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handle all incoming HTTPS requests.
  - Forward traffic to the internal Apache server over HTTP (no TLS required internally).

- **Configuration:**
  - Define server blocks for each application (e.g., NetDisco).
  - Implement security measures like rate limiting and basic access controls if necessary.

### **2.3. Internal Apache Web Server**

- **Modules Required:**
  - `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http` for reverse proxying.
  - `mod_headers` for setting HTTP headers.
  - `mod_auth_openidc` for OIDC authentication with Keycloak.

- **Authentication Flow:**
  - Apache uses `mod_auth_openidc` to authenticate users via Keycloak.
  - Upon successful authentication, Apache sets the `X-Remote-User` header with the authenticated username.
  - Proxies the request to NetDisco, passing the `X-Remote-User` header.

- **Future Integrations:**
  - Configure additional virtual hosts or directories for other legacy applications, ensuring each can receive authenticated user information as needed.

### **2.4. Intermediate Gateway Application (FastAPI)**

- **Purpose:**
  - Manage API access for utility scripts.
  - Handle token-based authentication, issuing and validating long-lived API tokens.

- **Features:**
  - **Token Generation:**
    - Provide endpoints for users to generate API tokens.
    - Associate tokens with user identities and store them securely.
  
  - **Token Validation:**
    - Middleware to validate tokens on incoming API requests.
    - Ensure tokens have appropriate scopes and are not expired.

  - **Security:**
    - Implement secure storage for tokens (e.g., encrypted database).
    - Provide manual token revocation mechanisms.

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Built with **FastAPI** for its asynchronous capabilities and ease of integration.
  - Utilize OAuth2 standards for token management where applicable.

### **2.5. Docker Compose Deployment**

- **Services Defined:**
  - **Keycloak:** Configuration for the IdP with necessary volumes and environment variables.
  - **External Nginx:** Configured with necessary reverse proxy settings.
  - **Internal Apache:** Includes necessary modules and configuration files.
  - **Gateway Application:** FastAPI service with access to necessary databases or storage for tokens.
  - **NetDisco:** If containerized, include service definition; otherwise, assume it's already running.
  
- **Networking:**
  - Define Docker networks to segregate services appropriately.
  - Ensure that only necessary ports are exposed externally via Nginx.

- **Volumes and Configurations:**
  - Persist configurations and data as needed (e.g., Keycloak databases, Apache configs).
  - Utilize Docker volumes for persistent storage where necessary.

### **2.6. Security Measures**

- **Internal Communications:**
  - No TLS required for internal HTTP connections, as infrastructure is secured and network-segmented.

- **Header Validation:**
  - Ensure that only the internal Apache server can set or modify the `X-Remote-User` header.
  - Implement Apache configurations to prevent header spoofing.

- **Token Security:**
  - Store API tokens securely within the gateway application.
  - Enforce strong token generation policies to prevent predictability.

- **Firewall and Network Segmentation:**
  - Use firewalls to protect internal services.
  - Segment networks to isolate internet-facing proxies from backend services.

### **2.7. Monitoring and Logging Integration**

- **Syslog Integration:**
  - Configure all services to forward logs to the centralized Syslog server.
  - Ensure consistent log formatting for ease of analysis.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Utilize existing monitoring tools to track service health, performance, and security events.
  - Set up alerts for critical events like authentication failures or unusual token usage.

## **3. Authentication and Authorization Flows**

### **3.1. Web Access Flow**

1. **User Access:**
   - User navigates to the NetDisco web application via the external Nginx proxy.

2. **HTTPS Termination:**
   - Nginx handles HTTPS and forwards the request to the internal Apache server.

3. **OIDC Authentication:**
   - Apache uses `mod_auth_openidc` to redirect the user to Keycloak for authentication.
   - User authenticates via Keycloak, leveraging LDAP/Kerberos for credentials.

4. **Authenticated Session:**
   - Upon successful authentication, Apache receives an ID token from Keycloak.
   - Apache sets the `X-Remote-User` header with the authenticated username.

5. **Access to NetDisco:**
   - Apache proxies the request to NetDisco, including the `X-Remote-User` header.
   - NetDisco processes the request, recognizing the authenticated user.

### **3.2. API Access Flow for Utility Scripts**

1. **Token Generation:**
   - Authorized users access the gateway application's token generation endpoint.
   - Users generate long-lived API tokens for script access.

2. **Script Authentication:**
   - Utility scripts include the API token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`) when making API requests to NetDisco.

3. **Token Validation:**
   - The gateway application validates the token, ensuring it is valid, not expired, and has the necessary permissions.

4. **Proxying Requests:**
   - Upon successful validation, the gateway proxies the request to NetDisco, potentially setting the `X-Remote-User` header based on the token's associated user.

5. **Access to NetDisco API:**
   - NetDisco processes the API request, recognizing the authenticated user via the `X-Remote-User` header.

## **4. Future-Proofing and Modular Design**

### **4.1. Adding New Legacy Applications**

- **Configuration:**
  - Define new virtual hosts or directories in the internal Apache server.
  - Utilize `mod_auth_openidc` to handle authentication similarly to NetDisco.
  - Set appropriate headers (`X-Remote-User`) for each application.

- **Gateway Adaptation:**
  - Ensure the gateway application can handle API requests from new applications by configuring necessary routes and token scopes.

### **4.2. Standard Integration Patterns**

- **Header Management:**
  - Standardize the use of headers like `X-Remote-User` across all integrated applications for consistency.

- **Authentication Handling:**
  - Utilize common authentication mechanisms (OIDC) to streamline the integration process for new applications.

- **Modular Gateway Functions:**
  - Design the gateway application with modular endpoints and services to easily support additional API integrations.
