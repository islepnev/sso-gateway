# Integration Test Setup

1. **Apache Reverse Proxy (`apache-proxy`):**
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point, handling HTTP requests and routing them appropriately.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Serves the `/gateway` path by reverse proxying to the `sso-gateway`.
     - Handles header forwarding (`X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`) to assist the SSO Gateway in constructing correct external URLs.
     - Bypasses `mod_auth_openidc` for the `/gateway/api` path, allowing the SSO Gateway to handle authentication independently.

2. **SSO Gateway (`sso-gateway`):**
   - **Purpose:** Manages authentication flows, token validation, and proxies API requests to the backend.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Handles `/gateway/auth/login`, `/gateway/auth/callback`, and `/gateway/auth/logout` routes for authentication.
     - Proxies requests to `/gateway/api/*` to the Dummy REST API after validating tokens and setting appropriate headers (`X-Remote-User`).
     - Serves the home page (`/gateway/`) with dynamic content based on authentication status.

3. **Dummy REST API (`dummy-api`):**
   - **Purpose:** Simulates a backend API for testing proxying and authentication flows.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Provides endpoints under `/api/*` that return JSON responses.
     - Accessible only internally within the Docker network to mimic a secured backend service.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - **Directory Structure:**
     - All Docker-related files and configurations are placed under a separate directory (e.g., `docker/`) to maintain organization and adhere to best practices.
     - Configuration files for each service are stored as separate YAML or conf files within this directory.
   - **External Keycloak Integration:**
     - The setup uses an external Keycloak instance for Identity Provider (IdP) functionalities.
     - Configuration details (e.g., `server_url`, `realm`, `client_id`, `client_secret`) are stored in dedicated configuration files to ensure flexibility and security.

5. **Environment Considerations:**
   - **Development Environment:**
     - HTTPS is **not** required to simplify the development setup.
     - Services communicate over HTTP within the Docker network.
   - **Standalone and Reverse Proxy Modes:**
     - The SSO Gateway is configured to function both as a standalone application and behind an Apache reverse proxy.
     - Utilizes `X-Forwarded-*` headers to accurately determine external URLs when behind a proxy.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - **Unified Logging Format:**
     - Configures both Apache and FastAPI (SSO Gateway) to use consistent logging formats for easier debugging and monitoring.
   - **Cache Control:**
     - Implements cache control headers to prevent stale content from being served, ensuring that authentication state changes are accurately reflected without requiring manual browser refreshes.
