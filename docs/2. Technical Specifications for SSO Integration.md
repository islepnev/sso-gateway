# Technical Specifications for SSO Integration with NetDisco

## Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications and conditions for integrating Single Sign-On (SSO) into the legacy web application **NetDisco**, utilizing **Keycloak** as the Identity Provider (IdP). The solution aims to ensure secure access for users and protect API endpoints for utility scripts within an internal infrastructure.

## Conditions

### 1. Identity Provider and User Federation
- **IdP Solution:** Keycloak using OpenID Connect.
- **User Federation:** LDAP and Kerberos backends.
- **Configuration:** Minimal and simple setup with a single realm (excluding master realm).
- **Data Storage:** All users and groups are managed through user federation.

### 2. Legacy Web Application: NetDisco
- **Framework:** Perl Dancer.
- **SSO Integration:** 
  - Currently trusts the web server for authorization via the `X-Remote-User` HTTP header.
  - Post-integration, NetDisco should receive the authenticated user in the `X-Remote-User` header of the `REMOTE_USER` variable.

### 3. User Access and Authentication
- **Access Protection:** 
  - Users accessing the NetDisco website must authenticate via SSO.
  - Authentication should be enforced through the SSO mechanism before granting access.

### 4. API Protection for Utility Scripts
- **Scope:** Utility scripts interact with multiple systems through REST APIs, including NetDisco.
- **Security Requirement:** All API access must be protected.
- **Environment Constraints:** 
  - Scripts run in a secured environment.
  - No callbacks from the IdP are possible; thus, token-based authentication is necessary.

### 5. Deployment Preferences
- **Containerization:** Deployment using Docker is preferred.
- **Orchestration:** Manual container management with Docker Compose; no use of Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

### 6. Web Server Preferences
- **Primary Web Server:** Apache is preferred.
- **Alternative:** Nginx may be used only if absolutely necessary.
- **External Reverse Proxy:** 
  - An external Nginx reverse proxy handles HTTPS termination.
  - No internal HTTP connections require TLS protection.

### 7. Integration and Architecture
- **Universal Integration Solution:** 
  - The solution should be adaptable for future integrations with other legacy web applications.
  - Example future integration includes a simple file browser based on Apache `mod_autoindex`.
- **Architecture Style:** 
  - Prefer modular architecture.
  - Utilize standard integration patterns to facilitate ease of maintenance and scalability.

### 8. Development and Support
- **Team Composition:** 
  - 1 DevOps lead.
  - Several junior engineers.
- **Manpower:** Limited resources; solutions should minimize maintenance overhead.
- **Programming Language:** Python is preferred, with the team having some experience in **FastAPI**.

### 9. Software and Infrastructure
- **Open-Source Preference:** 
  - Utilize only open-source solutions with community support.
  - Prefer well-known, long lifecycle solutions over unique or proprietary options.
- **Infrastructure Control:** 
  - Fully managed by the team.
  - No internal network boundaries; infrastructure is secured internally.
- **Network Segmentation:** 
  - Internet-facing web proxies are separated from backend services deployed within the LAN.
- **Security Measures:** 
  - The site is protected by a firewall.
  - No direct access to infrastructure from the Internet.

### 10. Monitoring and Logging
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Existing monitoring systems are in place.
- **Logging:** Centralized Syslog is utilized for logging across all services.

## Summary
This specification ensures that the SSO integration for NetDisco aligns with the organizational preferences for technology stack, deployment methods, security, and future scalability. The focus is on leveraging existing team expertise, utilizing open-source solutions, and maintaining a modular architecture to support current and future legacy applications.
